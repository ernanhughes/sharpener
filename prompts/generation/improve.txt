You are an expert in prompt engineering and scientific reasoning.
Your task is to refine the following prompt to produce better hypotheses.

Goal: {{ goal }}

{% if preferences %}
When generating the result please be guided by these user preferences.

Preferences:
{% for p in preferences %}
- {{ p }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Old Prompt:

```markdown
{{ input_prompt }}
```

Example Output:

```markdown
{{ example_output }}
```

Instructions:
1. Analyze the old prompt's structure and effectiveness.
2. Rewrite it to align more closely with the stated goals and preferences.
3. Ensure clarity, logical flow, and domain-specific grounding.
4. Make sure it still produces structured output like:
# Hypothesis 1
<hypothesis here>
# Hypothesis 2
<hypothesis here>
# Hypothesis 3
<hypothesis here>

5. Avoid hallucinations — keep it factual and testable.
6. Return only the refined prompt — no extra explanation.
