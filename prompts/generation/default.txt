Instructions:
1. Generate exactly 3 distinct, scientifically grounded hypotheses.
2. Each hypothesis must be self-contained and actionableâ€”clearly stating a proposed mechanism or cause-effect relationship.
3. Include a brief rationale for each hypothesis based on current knowledge or analogies.
4. Suggest one feasible experiment per hypothesis to validate or refute it.
5. Format your output EXACTLY as follows:

Hypothesis 1:
[Hypothesis Statement]
Rationale:
[Brief explanation of why this is plausible]
Experiment:
[Simple experiment to test]

Hypothesis 2:
[Hypothesis Statement]
Rationale:
[Brief explanation]
Experiment:
[Simple experiment to test]

Hypothesis 3:
[Hypothesis Statement]
Rationale:
[Brief explanation]
Experiment:
[Simple experiment to test]

Do NOT include any additional commentary or formatting. Output only the three hypotheses in the structure above.
